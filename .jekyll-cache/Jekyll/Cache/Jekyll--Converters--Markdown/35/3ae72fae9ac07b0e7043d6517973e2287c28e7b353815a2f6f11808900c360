I"§<p>PÃ¨re Davidâ€™s deer (Elaphurus davidianus), also known as the milu (Chinese: éº‹é¹¿; pinyin: mÃ­lÃ¹) or elaphure, is a species of deer that is currently extinct in the wildâ€”all known specimens are found only in captivity. 
This semiaquatic animal prefers marshland, and is native to the subtropics of China. 
It grazes mainly on grass and aquatic plants. 
It is the only extant member of the genus Elaphurus. 
Based on genetic comparisons, PÃ¨re Davidâ€™s deer is closely related to the deer of the genus Cervus, leading many experts to suggest merging Elaphurus into Cervus<sup>[1]</sup> or demoting Elaphurus to a subgenus of Cervus.</p>
